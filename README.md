# Aluminum Foil Reflectivity

Repository hosting the aluminum foil reflectivity measurements associated to the article:
[Household aluminum foil matte and bright side reflectivity measurements: Application to a photobioreactor light concentrator design.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X1930373X) Pozzobon, V., Levasseur, W., Do, K. V., Palpant, B., & Perré, P. (2020). *Biotechnology Reports*, 25, e00399.
Note: the article is in open access.
You can also find the data on [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gzzs4876vf/1).

# Data and structure

The measurements range from 250 to 2500 nm. They are given in %. 
The data file (*Diffuse_and_Specular_for_Bright_and_Matte_sides.txt*) is organized as follow:
* it is a text where values are delimited by a space
* the first column it the wavelength in nanometer (1 nm resolution measurements), the unit id in nm
* columns are then sorted out by sample: 1 & 2 for first measurement point on the dull/matte side, 3 & 4 for the second point on dull/matte side, 5 & 6 first point for the bright side and 7 & second point for the bright side
* for a given measurement point, the first column is the diffuse component and the second column is the specular component of the reflectivity, the unit is %

# Graphs

Here are some plot of diffuse and specular reflectivities for both sides (bright and dull) of an household aluminum foil.
