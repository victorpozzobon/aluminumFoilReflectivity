# Aluminum Foil Reflectivity

Repository hosting the aluminum foil reflectivity measurements associated to the article:
[Household aluminum foil matte and bright side reflectivity measurements: Application to a photobioreactor light concentrator design.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X1930373X) Pozzobon, V., Levasseur, W., Do, K. V., Palpant, B., & Perré, P. (2020). *Biotechnology Reports*, 25, e00399.
Note: the article is in open access.
You can also find the data on [Mendeley data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gzzs4876vf/1).

# Structure

The files are organized as follow:
* it is a text where values are delimited by a space
* the first column it the wavelength in nanometer (1 nm resolution measurements)
* columns are then sorted out by sample: 1 & 2 for first measurement point on the dull/matte side, 3 & 4 for the second point on dull/matte side, 5 & 6 first point for the bright side and 7 & second point for the bright side
* for a given measurement point, the first column is the diffuse component and the second column is the specular component of the reflectivity

# Graphs

Here are some plot of diffuse and specular reflectivities for both sides (bright and dull) of an household aluminum foil. 

Household aluminum foil diffuse reflectivity, at two different points on each side.
